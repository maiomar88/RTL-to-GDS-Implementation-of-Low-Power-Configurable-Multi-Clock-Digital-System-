# RTL-to-GDS-Implementation-of-Low-Power-Configurable-Multi-Clock-Digital-System-
- RTL Design from Scratch of system blocks (ALU, Register File, Synchronous FIFO,
Integer Clock Divider, Clock Gating, Synchronizers, Main Controller, UART TX,
UART RX).& Integrate and verify functionality through self-checking testbench.
- Constraining the system using synthesis TCL scripts,Synthesize and optimize the design
using design compiler tool.
- Analyze Timing paths and fix setup and hold violations.
- Verify Functionality equivalence using Formality tool
- Physical implementation of the system passing through ASIC flow phases and
generatethe GDS File, Synthesize and optimize the design using design compiler tool
